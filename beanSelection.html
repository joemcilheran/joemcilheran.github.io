		<pre> 
Do a quick internet search to see the thousands of places you can purchase
green, or raw coffee beans. Coffee beans have bean domesticated for thousands
of years, and the myriad resulting varieties all have their own distinct flavor
charactaristics, but the can be generally grouped by the region they were originally
cultivated in. Below you'll find a table of the main varieties of bean along with general 
charactaristics. No matter what bean you decide on, there are few things to keep in mind:
Beans should arrive in a sealed container. They should appear green and smell like p
fresh plant-life. Store in cool, dry places out of direct sun. The fresher the bean, 
the better the coffee.
