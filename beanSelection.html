     <p> 
Do a quick internet search to see the thousands of places you can purchase<br>
green, or raw coffee beans. Coffee beans have bean domesticated for thousands<br>
of years, and the myriad resulting varieties all have their own distinct flavor<br>
charactaristics, but the can be generally grouped by the region they were originally<br>
cultivated in. Below you'll find a table of the main varieties of bean along with general<br> 
charactaristics. No matter what bean you decide on, there are few things to keep in mind:<br>
Beans should arrive in a sealed container. They should appear green and smell like<br>
fresh plant-life. Store in cool, dry places out of direct sun. The fresher the bean,<br> 
the better the coffee.
